                    <h2>Why Saint-Petersburg?</h2>
                    <h3>Saint-Petersburg: The Venice of the North</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second largest city in Russia, St. Petersburg is rightfully called the cultural capital of
                        Russia. A metropolitan
                        city of five million people, it every year attracts nearly seven million tourists, of which
                        about one half are foreign
                        guests coming from all over the world. St. Petersburg was founded by the first Emperor of
                        Russia, Tsar Peter the Great
                        in 1703 as the new, western-style capital of Russia. Since its first days, St. Petersburg had
                        always been a
                        multicultural city, welcoming guests and specialists from other countries. Along with Russian
                        masters and architects,
                        many European builders and engineers contributed to the glory and beauty of the city.

                        St. Petersburg architecture is renown all over the world, and the draw bridges going up in the
                        middle of the night
                        fascinate all guests and residents of our city. In summer, you will get a chance to see the
                        famous White Nights and go
                        by boat along the numerous rivers and canals of the "Northern Venice." You can take a tour of
                        St. Petersburg roofs and
                        do a lot of other fantastic things you've never done before. To put you in the picture, we may
                        highlight a few must
                        things to do in St. Petersburg:

                        with it
                        Spend several days in the Hermitage (no one can see in one day. To see everything, you need at
                        least 24 years with no
                        days off, 8 hours per day, to proceed through all its exhibits. )
                        Visit the Russian Museum and its affiliate museums: the Mikhail's Castle, the Marble Palace, and
                        the famous Summer
                        Garden with the Summer Palace of Peter the Great
                        Go to the Kunstkamera, the first Russian museum founded by Peter the Great himself and imagine
                        yourself a person of the
                        18th century

                        great palaces, and parks
                        Go to Pushkin, where the most romantic palace in the necklace of summer royal residences is, and
                        Pavlovsk, with a palace
                        slightly smaller in size but with a much longer and enigmatic history
                        To see at least one performance of the glorious Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet
